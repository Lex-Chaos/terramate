# About Terramate

Terramate is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Management Platform that empowers teams to **organize**, **automate**, **orchestrate**
and **observe** IaC tools such as Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Kubernetes and others.

## What is Terramate

Terramate provides a new and better way to manage cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code by imposing structure,
workflows and best practices.

It's designed and implemented by long-time Platform Engineering and DevOps practitioners based on previous experience
with large-scale platforms - dozens of teams, hundreds of engineers, and tens of thousands of cloud resources.

At the same time, Terramate is super easy to start with - you can go from zero to fully managing your cloud resources
within less than 10 minutes, with no prerequisites. Terramate can be onboarded in any existing environment with a single
command, without modifying any existing configuration or causing hard vendor lock-in.
It integrates nicely in a non-intrusive way with your existing tooling, such as GitHub or Slack.

::: tip
Terramate is **not** a CI/CD platform. It integrates with your existing CI/CD such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD,
Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, Circle CI and Jenkins, allowing you to reuse compute, access management, etc. to
automate and orchestrate your IaC using GitOps workflow in a secure and cost-effective manner!

## Terramate CLI

Terramate CLI is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) orchestration and code generation tool for Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Kubernetes, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, CDK, Azure Resource Manager (ARM), and others. It helps you to **unify**, **simplify**
and **scale** all your infrastructure code, tools and workflows.





Terramate CLI is free, [open source](https://github.com/terramate-io/terramate) and optionally pairs with [Terramate Cloud](./cloud/index.md)
which provides better collaboration, observability, visibility and drift management for teams.


## Terramate Cloud

[Terramate Cloud](https://cloud.terramate.io/) is a fully managed service that provides **observability** and
**insights**, **deployment metrics**
(e.g., **DORA**), **notifications**, **drift management**, **asset management** and more that makes it easier to manage
infrastructure with IaC. It is free for individual use, with features available for teams.
