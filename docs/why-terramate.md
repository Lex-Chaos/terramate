# Why Terramate

We designed  Terramate because we believe companies spent too much time building their own IaC automations. At the same time
purpose built platforms are not idea, expensive, bad developer experience, etc.

- cheap
- secure
- allows you to stay in your native iac
- scalable
- multi repo
- any command
- none intrusive
- fast, scalable
- allows you to work native
